    text: "TTC Seminar definitely deepens the understanding of what tonal chiropractic is, when comparing with TRT. This approach invites us to understand more what the practice member's stuck pattern is, rather than going through steps that may avoid your awareness to the person on the table.",

    text: "The seminar was necessary for the evolution of the chiropractor going from a mechanistic to a more tonal approach. Tonal allows a person to unravel on the table. Tonal Chiropractic is very needed for the chiropractor in terms of evolution and awareness of the person they are serving on the table.",

    text: "This weekend was absolutely incredible! I've been practicing primarily TRT for the last 7 years, so I felt that I had a good knowledge of what tonal chiropractic was. But after this weekend he took it to such a deeper level of understanding. I'm so excited to go back and implement some of the awesome things I've learned!",
